    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
        With the increased reliance on wired networks, the vulnerability of these networks to malicious activities such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks becomes a significant concern. In this project, we utilize NS-3 to model accurate simulations of various DDos attack scenarios targeting the communication. The objective is to comprehend and contrast the impact of each attack on the performance of the targeted network. 
        The simulation setup allows us to deliberately generate and transmit attack traffic to the wired network. This makes it possible to observe and analyze various performance metrics, including throughput, packet loss, and checksum. Through comparing these metrics, we gain insights into the distinct behaviors and possible countermeasures for each type of DDoS attack.
        The outcomes of the simulation provide valuable insights for the development of more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques, and procedures to mitigate these attacks in wired networks environments. By understanding the behaviors of these attacks and their effects on network performance, we can design better strategies to enhance the durability and security of wired networks against DDos threats.
