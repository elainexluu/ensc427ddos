    <h1>A Simulation Study of DDOS Attacks on WiFi Networks</h1>
    
    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
        With the increase in the demand of WiFi networks, the vulnerability of these networks to malicious activities such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks becomes a critical concern. In this project, we utilize an ns-3 simulation to model three types of DDoS attacks being SYN floods, UDP floods, and Smurf floods on WiFi networks. The goal is to understand and compare the impact of each attack on the performance of the targeted network. The simulation setup lets us intentionally create and send attack traffic to the WiFi network. This allows us to watch and study different performance measures, like throughput, packet loss, and built-in security mechanisms, helping us understand how the network behaves during attacks. By comparing these metrics we gain insights into the unique behaviours and possible countermeasures for each type of DDoS attack. The simulation outcomes allows for the development of more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques, and procedures to counteract these attacks.
